This is a centralized directory of all /llms.txt files available online. The /llms.txt file is a proposed standard for websites to provide concise and structured information to help large language models (LLMs) efficiently use website content during inference time.

**Contributions are the backbone of this repository’s success. Let’s work together to build a comprehensive resource for /llms.txt files and advance the adoption of this standard for LLM-friendly content!**

The new submission process will make it easy to process the submissions.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

-   Curate a comprehensive list of /llms.txt files from various websites.
-   Provide a platform for contributors to share and update /llms.txt resources.
-   Support the adoption of /llms.txt as a standard for providing LLM-friendly content.

## What is /llms.txt?

/llms.txt is a file located in the root path of a website that provides a brief overview of the website and its purpose, lists key Markdown files containing detailed information for LLMs, uses Markdown to ensure human and LLM readability, and offers a structured approach to provide context for LLMs, facilitating easier access to relevant information.

For more details on the /llms.txt proposal, see the background and proposal documentation [here](https://llmstxt.org/).
